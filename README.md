# Computing Realistic Surrogate EEG for the Study of Functional Connectivity

This repository contains the code used to prepare the conference paper entitled "Computing Realistic Surrogate EEG for the Study of Functional Connectivity" 
currently available as a [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/uezdy/). This paper will be presented at the 2021 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on 
Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI; virtual conference; July 27-30, 2021) and should thereafter be published in the proceedings of the conference 
which will be available on [IEEE xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org).


## Abstract

Functional connectivity computed from electroencephalograms (EEG) can be used to better understand how the brain works. Unfortunately, 
estimating such connectivity is fraught with many pitfalls and can be confounded with artifacts due to volume conduction, common sources, 
reference scheme, etc. Devising a method to compute surrogate EEG that would be free of functional connectivity but that would reliably 
reproduce the effect of confounders such as volume conduction would be invaluable for statistical inference on functional connectivity. 
We developed such a method by simulating EEG from estimated sources and by reproducing the properties of local (but not long-range) 
functional connectivity in intracranial recordings. We present an example of how this approach can be used to improve the estimation of 
functional connectivity in EEG.
